        <h3 class="secondary-header text-center">Why investing in renewable energy?</h3>
        <div class="benefits pt-2">
            <div >
        <p  class="benefit-body"><b>Reduced Energy Costs:</b> Switching to renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines can significantly reduce your reliance on traditional grid electricity. This can lead to substantial savings on energy bills, with potential reductions of up to 70% or more.</p>
        </div>
            <div><p class="benefit-body right">
               <b>Long-Term Cost Stability:</b> Unlike fossil fuels, which are subject to price fluctuations and geopolitical factors, renewable energy sources offer more stable and predictable costs over the long term. This can provide homeowners with greater financial security and protection against rising energy prices.
            </p> </div>
            <div><p class="benefit-body "><b>Environmental Impact: </b>Renewable energy produces little to no greenhouse gas emissions, helping to combat climate change and reduce the carbon footprint of your home. By investing in renewables, homeowners contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable future for generations to come.
            </p> </div>
            <div><p class="benefit-body right"><b>Energy Independence:</b>Generating your own renewable energy gives you greater control over your energy supply. You become less reliant on external energy providers and can have peace of mind knowing that you have a reliable and sustainable source of power right at your home.

        <h4 class="mt-4">Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>Credit options provide individuals with the opportunity to make purchases or access funds without immediate payment, relying on borrowed funds instead. While credit can be beneficial for managing expenses and meeting financial needs, it is important to be aware of the risks involved. One significant risk is the potential accumulation of debt if credit is not managed responsibly. Failure to make timely payments or exceeding credit limits can result in high interest charges, penalties, and negative impacts on credit scores. Additionally, taking on too much credit can lead to financial stress and difficulty in meeting other financial obligations. It is crucial to carefully consider and assess one's financial situation, repayment capabilities, and the terms and conditions of credit options before making borrowing decisions. Responsible credit management, including budgeting, monitoring spending, and making regular payments, is essential to mitigate these risks and ensure a positive credit experience.</p>
